      <!-- init() creates a local variable called name and a function called displayName(). The displayName() function is an inner function that is defined inside init() and is available only within the body of the init() function. Note that the displayName() function has no local variables of its own. However, since inner functions have access to the variables of outer functions, displayName() can access the variable name declared in the parent function, init().-->

    <!-- A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to 
        its surrounding state (the lexical environment). When you create a closure, 
        you gain access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. Closures are automatically 
        created every time a function is defined in JavaScript.
     Closure is the concept of function + lexical environment in which function it was created.
      so every function declared within another function then it has access to the scope chain of the outer function and
      the variables created within the scope of the outer function will not get destroyed.-->
    //uses of closure: module design pattern,currying, function like
    once,memoize,maintaining state in async world,setTimeouts,iterators...
